1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:03,622
And I'm gonna show you some simple home remedies that you could do at home.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,327
So basically you don't have to go back to the dry cleaner, cause I think

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,500
you know most people. Yes.

4
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:14,647
There you go. All right, so where are we starting? So we're going to start

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,222
off with the first. By the way, there are three different stain

6
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:22,317
groups. To 95% of all stains come from three different groups.

7
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:25,452
The first group is from the Earth. That's anything from the Earth,

8
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:29,047
like fruit juices, colas, teas, red wines. Okay.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,437
The second is from the body, which is protein. Anything live matter

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,177
from the body. All the icky stuff, like blood, milk, perspiration.

11
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:39,852
Okay. And the third is all oil matter. That's mineral, vegetable,

12
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:43,122
and petroleum oils. That can be from hair gels to cooking oils, greases,

13
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:47,037
et cetera. Let's test makeup. Exactly. The first category

14
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:50,292
is earth based, so we're going to take some coffee,

15
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:53,827
okay. Which is everyone's got a coffee stain. And we're going to stain it

16
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,097
on this item right here. But what we make to

17
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:00,702
make the solution at home is we're going to take 2oz of dishwashing

18
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:03,832
detergent, a degreaser, pour it in, okay.

19
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,872
2oz of vinegar, one piece of white vinegar, and go ahead. And 2oz

20
00:01:07,917 --> 00:01:11,527
of water. Okay. Simple enough. And we're just going to mix it up.

21
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:15,862
Okay. And what you always do before

22
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,702
you use this on anything, you always want to test the

23
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:23,302
solution in an inconspicuous area of the garment to

24
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,602
make sure that the color doesn't bleed. Because you can

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,162
go right on, the color starts bleeding,

26
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:34,162
this flap on the inside of the ship. And you always want to

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,837
with an earth based stain, you always want to just rinse it with cold water

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,152
just to see if it's going to come out because it's fresh. We're going to

29
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:44,772
take the formula and we're going to tamp it right on top of the stain.

30
00:01:44,817 --> 00:01:48,322
You can see it, right? And it passes, like, right through. It passes right through.

31
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,600
Wow. You can see that.

32
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:55,417
That's awesome. There it goes. Okay, number two, we're going to

33
00:01:55,465 --> 00:01:59,472
the protein based thing. So we chose

34
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:02,772
since we're in the kitchen here, we chose meat,

35
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:06,927
juice, blood. Okay. So we take two tablespoons of water, a teaspoon

36
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:10,542
of ammonia, a teaspoon of peroxide, hydrogen peroxide.

37
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:13,482
Hydrogen peroxide, and a teaspoon of detergent.

38
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:17,517
Okay, again. All right. When I see ingredients

39
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:19,925
there you go. This is good.

40
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:24,022
Okay. So what we're going to do is pour it on.

41
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:27,322
Yeah. And by the way, one of the other tips is if you ever have

42
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,262
excess amount of the solution

43
00:02:31,612 --> 00:02:35,375
or no excess amount of stain, just take it off. Take it off with

44
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,675
a round object, a spoon or something. Got you.

45
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:42,577
There you go. And just tamp. Beautiful. Look at

46
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:46,162
that. The last squad. Let me get this right. Last group,

47
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:48,997
I'm going to just take a this is the makeup, the oil based. Yeah.

48
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:52,582
This is the lady stuff or just the oil based stuff.

49
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:56,427
So we're going to use this wherever

50
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:59,557
you want or you want to do it. Now, we always

51
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:03,397
start with an ounce of degreaser and

52
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,247
an ounce of a tablespoon or an ounce of water.

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,177
Now, to make this stronger, if you need to,

54
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,650
we add acetone. Okay,

55
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:18,177
it works. But as long as you don't

56
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:22,087
have any acetate fabric right, then you can use that. It will definitely

57
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,937
melt it, you'll see? Okay. There you go. So now let me grab

58
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:30,142
one of these. Can I spoon it on, please? Keep a spoon it on.

59
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,042
She knows how it this is good French service for your same.

60
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:37,925
There you go. Okay. And there

61
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:42,437
you can see it coming off. Wow. And that was bright pink lipstick.

62
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:46,897
If you just let it sit there, sometimes it works. Over time, it's getting through.

63
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,652
So you can't always be in a rush to remove stains, and then you wash

64
00:03:50,682 --> 00:03:54,575
it afterwards. There's a mild detergent and

65
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:57,575
clorox to a safety bleach. Oh, cool. Yeah.

66
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:07,200
Thank you.
