1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:03,622
And I'm gonna show you some simple home remedies that you could do at home.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:06,952
So basically you don't have to go back to the dry cleaner, cause I

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,500
think you know most people. Yes.

4
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:14,647
There you go. All right, so where are we starting? So we're going to start

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,812
off with the first. By the way, there are three different

6
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:21,052
stain groups. To 95% of all stains come

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,102
from three different groups. The first group is from the Earth. That's anything from

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,737
the Earth, like fruit juices, colas, teas, red wines.

9
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:32,437
Okay. The second is from the body, which is protein. Anything live matter

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,322
from the body. All the icky stuff, like blood, milk,

11
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:38,662
perspiration. Okay. And the third is all oil matter.

12
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:42,672
That's mineral, vegetable, and petroleum oils. That can be from hair gels to cooking oils,

13
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:47,037
greases, et cetera. Let's test makeup. Exactly. The first category

14
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:50,292
is earth based, so we're going to take some coffee,

15
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:54,247
okay. Which is everyone's got a coffee stain. And we're going to stain it on

16
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:58,147
this item right here. But what we make to make the solution at

17
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,232
home is we're going to take 2oz of dishwashing detergent, a degreaser,

18
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:05,872
pour it in, okay. 2oz of vinegar, one piece of

19
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:08,722
white vinegar, and go ahead. And 2oz of water.

20
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:11,527
Okay. Simple enough. And we're just going to mix it up.

21
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:15,862
Okay. And what you always do before

22
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:19,702
you use this on anything, you always want to test the

23
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:23,097
solution in an inconspicuous area of the garment

24
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:26,482
to make sure that the color doesn't bleed. Because you

25
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,162
can go right on, the color starts bleeding,

26
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:34,162
this flap on the inside of the ship. And you always want to

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,497
with an earth based stain, you always want to just rinse it with cold

28
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:40,497
water just to see if it's going to come out because it's fresh.

29
00:01:40,617 --> 00:01:43,897
We're going to take the formula and we're going to tamp it right

30
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:46,402
on top of the stain. You can see it, right? And it passes, like,

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,972
right through. It passes right through. Wow. You can see

32
00:01:50,005 --> 00:01:53,572
that. That's awesome. There it goes.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,037
Okay, number two, we're going to the protein based

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,337
thing. So we chose since

35
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:03,312
we're in the kitchen here, we chose meat, juice,

36
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:06,927
blood. Okay. So we take two tablespoons of water, a teaspoon

37
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:09,567
of ammonia, a teaspoon of peroxide,

38
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:13,482
hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide, and a teaspoon of detergent.

39
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:17,517
Okay, again. All right. When I see ingredients

40
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:20,842
there you go. This is good. Okay.

41
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,427
So what we're going to do is pour it on. Yeah.

42
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,047
And by the way, one of the other tips is if you ever have excess

43
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:32,107
amount of the solution or

44
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,202
no excess amount of stain, just take it off. Take it off with a

45
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,847
round object, a spoon or something. Got you. There you go.

46
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,952
And just tamp. Beautiful. Look at that.

47
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:46,162
The last squad. Let me get this right. Last group,

48
00:02:46,225 --> 00:02:48,997
I'm going to just take a this is the makeup, the oil based. Yeah.

49
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:52,582
This is the lady stuff or just the oil based stuff.

50
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:56,427
So we're going to use this wherever

51
00:02:56,457 --> 00:03:00,007
you want or you want to do it. Now, we always start

52
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:03,667
with an ounce of degreaser and an

53
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:06,817
ounce of a tablespoon or an ounce of water. Now,

54
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:10,177
to make this stronger, if you need to,

55
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,650
we add acetone. Okay,

56
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:18,177
it works. But as long as you don't

57
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:21,322
have any acetate fabric right, then you can use that.

58
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:24,847
It will definitely melt it, you'll see? Okay. There you go. So now

59
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,072
let me grab one of these.

60
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,922
Can I spoon it on, please? Keep a spoon it on. She knows how it

61
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:34,627
this is good French service for your same. There you

62
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:38,707
go. Okay. And there you

63
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,437
can see it coming off. Wow. And that was bright pink lipstick.

64
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:46,297
If you just let it sit there, sometimes it works. Over time,

65
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,377
it's getting through. So you can't always be in a rush to remove stains,

66
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:53,202
and then you wash it afterwards. There's a mild

67
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:56,677
detergent and clorox to a safety bleach. Oh,

68
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,575
cool. Yeah.

69
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:07,200
Thank you.
