1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:03,622
And I'm gonna show you some simple home remedies that you could do at home.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,327
So basically you don't have to go back to the dry cleaner, cause I think

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,500
you know most people. Yes.

4
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:14,647
There you go. All right, so where are we starting? So we're going to start

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,222
off with the first. By the way, there are three different stain

6
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:21,667
groups. To 95% of all stains come from three different

7
00:00:21,715 --> 00:00:25,102
groups. The first group is from the Earth. That's anything from

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,737
the Earth, like fruit juices, colas, teas, red wines.

9
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:32,677
Okay. The second is from the body, which is protein. Anything live matter from

10
00:00:32,695 --> 00:00:35,322
the body. All the icky stuff, like blood, milk,

11
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:38,662
perspiration. Okay. And the third is all oil matter.

12
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:42,267
That's mineral, vegetable, and petroleum oils. That can be from hair gels to cooking

13
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:45,397
oils, greases, et cetera. Let's test makeup. Exactly.

14
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,877
The first category is earth based, so we're going to

15
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:52,812
take some coffee, okay. Which is everyone's got a coffee stain.

16
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,452
And we're going to stain it on this item right here. But what

17
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,922
we make to make the solution at home is we're going to take 2oz

18
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:03,292
of dishwashing detergent, a degreaser, pour it in,

19
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:07,147
okay. 2oz of vinegar, one piece of white vinegar, and go ahead.

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,752
And 2oz of water. Okay. Simple enough. And we're just going to mix

21
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:14,900
it up. Okay. And what you always do

22
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:18,997
before you use this on anything, you always want to test

23
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:22,447
the solution in an inconspicuous area

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,482
of the garment to make sure that the color doesn't bleed. Because you

25
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,162
can go right on, the color starts bleeding,

26
00:01:30,487 --> 00:01:34,162
this flap on the inside of the ship. And you always want to

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,837
with an earth based stain, you always want to just rinse it with cold water

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,032
just to see if it's going to come out because it's fresh. We're going

29
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:44,482
to take the formula and we're going to tamp it right on top of the

30
00:01:44,485 --> 00:01:47,842
stain. You can see it, right? And it passes, like, right through. It passes right

31
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,600
through. Wow. You can see that.

32
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:54,592
That's awesome. There it goes. Okay, number two,

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,367
we're going to the protein based thing.

34
00:01:57,415 --> 00:02:00,732
So we chose since we're

35
00:02:00,747 --> 00:02:03,957
in the kitchen here, we chose meat, juice, blood.

36
00:02:04,047 --> 00:02:07,827
Okay. So we take two tablespoons of water, a teaspoon of ammonia,

37
00:02:07,932 --> 00:02:11,742
a teaspoon of peroxide, hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide,

38
00:02:11,802 --> 00:02:15,500
and a teaspoon of detergent. Okay, again. All right.

39
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:19,925
When I see ingredients there you go. This is good.

40
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:24,022
Okay. So what we're going to do is pour it on.

41
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:27,322
Yeah. And by the way, one of the other tips is if you ever have

42
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,107
excess amount of the solution or

43
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:36,202
no excess amount of stain, just take it off. Take it off with a

44
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,847
round object, a spoon or something. Got you. There you go.

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,952
And just tamp. Beautiful. Look at that.

46
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:46,657
The last squad. Let me get this right. Last group, I'm going to

47
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,097
just take a this is the makeup, the oil based. Yeah. This is the lady

48
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:53,607
stuff or just the oil based stuff. So we're

49
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:56,902
going to use this wherever you want or

50
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,727
you want to do it. Now, we always start with

51
00:03:00,895 --> 00:03:04,977
an ounce of degreaser and an ounce of a tablespoon

52
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:08,742
or an ounce of water. Now, to make this stronger,

53
00:03:08,802 --> 00:03:11,937
if you need to, we add acetone.

54
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:12,650
Okay,

55
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:18,592
it works. But as long as you don't have any

56
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,422
acetate fabric right, then you can use that. It will definitely melt

57
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:27,502
it, you'll see? Okay. There you go. So now let me grab one

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,582
of these. Can I spoon it on, please? Keep a spoon it on. She knows

59
00:03:30,597 --> 00:03:34,042
how it this is good French service for your same.

60
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:37,925
There you go. Okay. And there

61
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:41,622
you can see it coming off. Wow. And that was bright pink

62
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,647
lipstick. If you just let it sit there,

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,782
sometimes it works. Over time, it's getting through. So you can't always be in a

64
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:51,812
rush to remove stains, and then you wash it afterwards.

65
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:55,602
There's a mild detergent and clorox

66
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:57,575
to a safety bleach. Oh, cool. Yeah.

67
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:07,200
Thank you.
