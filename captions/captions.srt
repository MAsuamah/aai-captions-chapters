1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:03,622
And I'm gonna show you some simple home remedies that you could do at home.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,327
So basically you don't have to go back to the dry cleaner, cause I think

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,500
you know most people. Yes.

4
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:14,647
There you go. All right, so where are we starting? So we're going to start

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,812
off with the first. By the way, there are three different

6
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:21,247
stain groups. To 95% of all stains come from

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,102
three different groups. The first group is from the Earth. That's anything from

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,737
the Earth, like fruit juices, colas, teas, red wines.

9
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:32,437
Okay. The second is from the body, which is protein. Anything live matter

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,322
from the body. All the icky stuff, like blood, milk,

11
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:39,447
perspiration. Okay. And the third is all oil matter. That's mineral,

12
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:42,672
vegetable, and petroleum oils. That can be from hair gels to cooking oils,

13
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:46,087
greases, et cetera. Let's test makeup. Exactly. The first

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:49,522
category is earth based, so we're going to take some

15
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:52,812
coffee, okay. Which is everyone's got a coffee stain.

16
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,872
And we're going to stain it on this item right here. But what we make

17
00:00:56,905 --> 00:01:00,127
to make the solution at home is we're going to take 2oz of

18
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:03,292
dishwashing detergent, a degreaser, pour it in,

19
00:01:03,415 --> 00:01:06,097
okay. 2Oz of vinegar, one piece of white.

20
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,292
Vinegar, and go ahead. And 2oz of water. Okay.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,425
Simple enough. And we're just going to mix it up. Okay.

22
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:16,147
And what you always do before you

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:19,702
use this on anything, you always want to test the

24
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:23,602
solution in an inconspicuous area of the garment to make sure

25
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,127
that the color doesn't bleed. Because you can go right on,

26
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:31,272
the. Color starts bleeding, this flap

27
00:01:31,317 --> 00:01:34,857
on the inside of the ship. And you always want to with an earth

28
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:38,377
based stain, you always want to just rinse it with cold water just to see

29
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:42,117
if it's going to come out because it's fresh. We're going to take the formula

30
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:45,202
and we're going to tamp it right on top of the stain. You can see

31
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,322
it, right? And it passes, like, right through. It passes right through.

32
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,642
Wow. You can see that. That's awesome.

33
00:01:52,765 --> 00:01:56,032
There it goes. Okay, number two, we're going to the

34
00:01:56,185 --> 00:02:00,337
protein based thing. So we chose since

35
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:03,312
we're in the kitchen here, we chose meat, juice,

36
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:06,927
blood. Okay. So we take two tablespoons of water, a teaspoon

37
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:10,542
of ammonia, a teaspoon of peroxide, hydrogen peroxide.

38
00:02:10,602 --> 00:02:13,957
Hydrogen peroxide, and a teaspoon of detergent. Okay,

39
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:17,517
again. All right. When I see ingredients

40
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:21,382
there you go. This is good. Okay. So what we're going

41
00:02:21,385 --> 00:02:25,027
to do is pour it on. Yeah. And by the

42
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,582
way, one of the other tips is if you ever have excess amount

43
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,772
of the solution or no excess

44
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:36,492
amount of stain, just take it off. Take it off with a round

45
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:39,847
object. A spoon or something. Got you. There you go.

46
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,872
And just tamp. Beautiful. Look at that. The last squad.

47
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:47,377
Let me get this right. Last group, I'm going to just take. A this is

48
00:02:47,395 --> 00:02:51,322
the makeup, the oil based. Yeah. This is the lady stuff or just the

49
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:55,025
oil based stuff. So we're going to use this

50
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:59,557
wherever you want or you want to do it. Now, we always

51
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:03,667
start with an ounce of degreaser and an

52
00:03:03,715 --> 00:03:06,247
ounce of a tablespoon or an ounce of water.

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,177
Now, to make this stronger, if you need to,

54
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,650
we add acetone. Okay,

55
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:19,152
it works. But as long as you don't have any acetate

56
00:03:19,182 --> 00:03:22,422
fabric right, then you can use that. It will definitely melt

57
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:25,937
it, you'll see? Okay. There you go. So now let me grab

58
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:30,142
one of these. Can I spoon it on, please? Keep a spoon it on.

59
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,042
She knows how it this is good. French service for your same.

60
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:37,925
There you go. Okay. And there

61
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:41,622
you can see it coming off. Wow. And that was bright pink

62
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:45,472
lipstick. If you just let it sit there, sometimes it

63
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:48,127
works. Over time, it's getting through. So you can't always be in a rush to

64
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,812
remove stains, and then you wash it afterwards.

65
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:55,602
There's a mild detergent and clorox

66
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:57,575
to a safety bleach. Oh, cool. Yeah.

67
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:07,200
Thank you.
