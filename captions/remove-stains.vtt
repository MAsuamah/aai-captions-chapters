1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:03,622
And I'm gonna show you some simple home remedies that you could do at home.

2
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:07,327
So basically you don't have to go back to the dry cleaner, cause I think

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,500
you know most people. Yes.

4
00:00:11,437 --> 00:00:14,647
There you go. All right, so where are we starting? So we're going to start

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,672
off with the first. By the way, there are three different stain groups.

6
00:00:18,717 --> 00:00:22,317
To 95% of all stains come from three different groups.

7
00:00:22,452 --> 00:00:25,452
The first group is from the Earth. That's anything from the Earth,

8
00:00:25,482 --> 00:00:28,737
like fruit juices, colas, teas, red wines.

9
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:32,437
Okay. The second is from the body, which is protein. Anything live matter

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,177
from the body. All the icky stuff, like blood, milk, perspiration.

11
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:39,447
Okay. And the third is all oil matter. That's mineral,

12
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:42,672
vegetable, and petroleum oils. That can be from hair gels to cooking oils,

13
00:00:42,717 --> 00:00:47,037
greases, et cetera. Let's test makeup. Exactly. The first category

14
00:00:47,187 --> 00:00:50,292
is earth based, so we're going to take some coffee,

15
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:53,827
okay. Which is everyone's got a coffee stain. And we're going to stain it

16
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,277
on this item right here. But what we make to make

17
00:00:57,295 --> 00:01:00,702
the solution at home is we're going to take 2oz of dishwashing

18
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:04,582
detergent, a degreaser, pour it in, okay. 2oz of

19
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:08,722
vinegar, one piece of white vinegar, and go ahead. And 2oz of water.

20
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:11,527
Okay. Simple enough. And we're just going to mix it up.

21
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:15,862
Okay. And what you always do before

22
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:20,487
you use this on anything, you always want to test the solution

23
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:24,142
in an inconspicuous area of the garment to make sure that the color

24
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,147
doesn't bleed. Because you can go right on, the color

25
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,792
starts bleeding, this flap on the inside

26
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,092
of the ship. And you always want to with an earth based

27
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,377
stain, you always want to just rinse it with cold water just to see

28
00:01:38,395 --> 00:01:42,117
if it's going to come out because it's fresh. We're going to take the formula

29
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:45,202
and we're going to tamp it right on top of the stain. You can see

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,322
it, right? And it passes, like, right through. It passes right through.

31
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,600
Wow. You can see that.

32
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:54,592
That's awesome. There it goes. Okay, number two,

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,612
we're going to the protein based thing. So we

34
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:02,772
chose since we're in the kitchen here, we chose meat,

35
00:02:02,817 --> 00:02:06,097
juice, blood. Okay. So we take two tablespoons of water,

36
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:09,567
a teaspoon of ammonia, a teaspoon of peroxide,

37
00:02:09,627 --> 00:02:13,482
hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide, and a teaspoon of detergent.

38
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:17,517
Okay, again. All right. When I see ingredients

39
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:21,157
there you go. This is good. Okay. So what

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,022
we're going to do is pour it on.

41
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:27,322
Yeah. And by the way, one of the other tips is if you ever have

42
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,547
excess amount of the

43
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,847
solution or no excess amount of stain, just take

44
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,432
it off. Take it off with a round object, a spoon or

45
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:40,767
something. Got you. There you go. And just tamp.

46
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:44,152
Beautiful. Look at that. The last squad. Let me

47
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,482
get this right. Last group, I'm going to just take a this is the

48
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:51,097
makeup, the oil based. Yeah. This is the lady stuff or just

49
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,025
the oil based stuff. So we're going to use this

50
00:02:55,987 --> 00:02:58,927
wherever you want or you want to do it. Now,

51
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,612
we always start with an ounce of degreaser

52
00:03:03,037 --> 00:03:06,247
and an ounce of a tablespoon or an ounce of water.

53
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,177
Now, to make this stronger, if you need to,

54
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,650
we add acetone. Okay,

55
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:18,352
it works. But as long as you don't have

56
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,802
any acetate fabric right, then you can use that. It will

57
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,982
definitely melt it, you'll see? Okay. There you go. So now let

58
00:03:24,985 --> 00:03:28,072
me grab one of these.

59
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,922
Can I spoon it on, please? Keep a spoon it on. She knows how it

60
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:34,042
this is good French service for your same.

61
00:03:34,165 --> 00:03:37,925
There you go. Okay. And there

62
00:03:38,437 --> 00:03:41,622
you can see it coming off. Wow. And that was bright pink

63
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,647
lipstick. If you just let it sit there,

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,782
sometimes it works. Over time, it's getting through. So you can't always be in a

65
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:51,812
rush to remove stains, and then you wash it afterwards.

66
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:55,602
There's a mild detergent and clorox

67
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:57,575
to a safety bleach. Oh, cool. Yeah.

68
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:07,200
Thank you.
